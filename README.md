# Wiki Prevodilac (Target: Serbian Wikipedia)

Wiki Prevodilac is a specialized utility for editors working on the **Serbian Wikipedia (sr.wikipedia.org)**. It streamlines the process of localizing content from other language versions.

### Key Features:
* **Multilingual Source:** Import wikitext from the top 15+ Wikipedia languages or any custom language code.
* **Serbian Localization:** Automatically finds Serbian equivalents for templates and categories using Wikidata.
* **Template Transfer Suite:** If a template is missing on Serbian Wikipedia, the tool provides one-click API buttons to copy the source code and documentation from the source wiki.
* **Smart Sorting:** Displays successfully localized items (Green) at the top, followed by missing items (Red), while maintaining their original relative order.
* **Cyrillic Interface:** The entire user interface is in Serbian Cyrillic for a native editing experience.

### Purpose
This tool is designed to bridge the gap between global Wikipedia content and the Serbian language edition, making it easier for translators to maintain template and category structures.
